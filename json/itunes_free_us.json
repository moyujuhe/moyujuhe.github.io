Our latest product update is a huge deal. We’re talking about the implementation of WireGuard - the next-generation secure tunneling VPN protocol. Right now, we’re putting it out there for you as a Beta. Besides this, we’ve also made various bug fixes and added some soft-touch overall improvements that we think make this release the best one yet. We hope you’ll enjoy it too!  \n\nStay safe, #stayathome, and keep an eye out for our next updates!"

It opens up your frontal lobe, which controls organizing and problem-solving, and allows you to put everything else aside and be present in the moment, generating focus. Choose an illustration that speaks to you and color it however you like. Remember, this is a safe place, where you can do no wrong, everything goes. \n\n[PSSSST]\nYou know that comforting sound pencils make when you are coloring on paper? You will soon be able to experience it in your favorite digital coloring book. Stay close. \n\nLots of love and support,\nLake team\n\nHave something to tell us?
