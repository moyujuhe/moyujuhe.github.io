Our latest product update is a huge deal. We’re talking about the implementation of WireGuard - the next-generation secure tunneling VPN protocol. Right now, we’re putting it out there for you as a Beta. Besides this, we’ve also made various bug fixes and added some soft-touch overall improvements that we think make this release the best one yet. We hope you’ll enjoy it too!  \n\nStay safe, #stayathome, and keep an eye out for our next updates!"
