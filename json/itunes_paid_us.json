We’ve kicked it up a notch, from entry-level to expert, Freya 2.0 is everything you’ve been dreaming of...\n\nYou can now skip, reorder and even remove tracks from the guided relaxation playlist, so you listen to what you want, when you want. What’s more if things begin to feel a little repetitive you can now listen to your own playlist on a third party app (such a Spotify) whilst still using the Freya app to keep track of your surges and coach you through each one.\n\nTalking of surges, if breathing out for a full 8 seconds leaves you gasping for air like a guppy fish, you’ll be pleased to know that you can now switch between the 4-8 breathing pattern and the more manageable 3-6. You can also turn off the counting altogether if you prefer.\n\nWe’ve also improved our navigation, enabling you to send us feedback more easily, as well as sign up to our newsletter without leaving the app. The latter is sent out weekly and is jam-packed with great stuff - sure, we’re probably a little biased but we think it’ll be the best thing in your inbox.  \n\nWhat ya waiting for?
