We hope very much that this huge update will redeem us. And there's no reason to think otherwise: the number and the scale of changes is enormous.\nFirst of all, a complete UI rework. This implies much more than a mere reskin. New overall style, new menu logic, new icons and widgets. You'll notice the contrast with the old version right away, and hopefully you'll find it better, like we do.\nContent blockers: a brand new addition to AdGuard Pro. It's a set of features that ultimately improves ad blocking in Safari and helps you manage and customize the filtering process.\nThere's much more to explore: for example, Activity feed (think renovated Requests Log) that will not only conveniently display your DNS requests but also give you exhaustive details about them.\nGive the reborn AdGuard Pro a try and you won't be disappointed!"
